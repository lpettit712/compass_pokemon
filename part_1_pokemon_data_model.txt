Notes:
Datasets created are below.
While loading I loaded data for all moves, pokemon types & pokemon instead of just
the first 15. In the queries I filtered for the first 15 pokemon.

DATA MODEL
dim_moves: Building a moves dimension to track move attributes. Including pokemon_type here as there is only 1 per move
- move_id (Primary Key)
- move_name
- accuracy
- pokemon_type_name

dim_pokemon: Building a pokemon dimension to track pokemon attributes
- pokemon_id (Primary Key)
- pokemon_name
- pokemon_weight

dim_pokemon_types: Building a pokemon types dimension to track pokemon type attributes
- type_id (Primary Key)
- type_name

pokemon_to_pokemon_type_mapping: The relationship between pokemon & pokemon types is many to many. Include for mappings
- pokemon_id
- type_id

pokemon_to_moves_mapping: The relationship between pokemon & moves is many to many. Include for mappings
- pokemon_id
- move_id
